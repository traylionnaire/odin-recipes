    <h3>
      <p>
        Carbonara is a creamy pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, cured meat, and black pepper. It is rich, smooth, and comforting, perfect for a quick but satisfying meal.
      </p>
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      This recipe uses spaghetti, crispy bacon or pancetta, eggs, and grated cheese to create a silky sauce. The creaminess comes from the eggs and cheese mixed with hot pasta, not from heavy cream in the traditional version. The heat from the pasta gently cooks the eggs, forming a smooth coating around every strand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Timing is important when making carbonara. The pasta must be hot enough to cook the eggs slightly but not too hot to scramble them. Tossing everything quickly ensures a glossy sauce that clings perfectly to the noodles.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>400 grams pasta</li>
      <li>200 grams bacon or pancetta, chopped</li>
      <li>2 whole eggs</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt for pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps in Cooking</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil a large pot of water. Add salt and cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta cooks, heat a pan over medium heat and cook the bacon until crispy. Turn off the heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, grated cheese, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately add the hot pasta to the pan with the bacon. Toss well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pan from direct heat and pour in the egg mixture. Toss quickly to coat the pasta evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a little reserved pasta water if needed to create a smooth, creamy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
          Serve immediately with extra cheese and black pepper on top.
      </li>
    </ol>
