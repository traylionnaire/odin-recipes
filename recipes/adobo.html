    <h3>
      <p>
        Adobong Baboy is a famous Filipino dish made by simmering pork in soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and spices. It has a rich, savory, and slightly tangy flavor that pairs perfectly with steamed rice.

    <p>
      This recipe uses pork belly for a tender and juicy texture. The combination of soy sauce and vinegar creates the signature balance of salty and sour taste. Garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns add depth and aroma to the dish
    </p>

    <p>
      The secret to a flavorful adobo is slow cooking. Allowing the pork to simmer gently helps the meat absorb the sauce and become soft. Some people reduce the sauce further to make it thicker and richer, depending on personal preference.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kilogram pork belly, cut into cubes</li>
      <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vinegar</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar, optional</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps in Cooking</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Sauté the garlic until lightly golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pork and cook until the outside turns light brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the soy sauce and water. Add the bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes until the pork becomes tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the vinegar. Do not stir for the first 2 to 3 minutes. Let it boil to cook off the strong vinegar taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar if desired. Stir gently and continue simmering for another 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook uncovered if you want the sauce to reduce and thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and adjust with salt if needed. Serve hot with steamed rice.
      </li>
    </ol>
