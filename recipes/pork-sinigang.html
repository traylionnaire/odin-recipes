    <p>
      A classic Filipino sour soup made with tender pork, fresh vegetables, and a tamarind based broth. It is warm, comforting, and perfect for rainy days or family meals.
    </p>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    This recipe uses pork belly for a rich and flavorful broth. The sour taste comes from tamarind, which gives the soup its signature tangy flavor. Fresh vegetables like radish, eggplant, and water spinach add texture and balance to the savory pork.
  </p>

  <p>
    The key to a delicious sinigang is slow simmering. Cooking the pork gently makes it soft and allows the flavors to blend well. The vegetables are added at the right time so they stay tender but not overcooked, giving you a hearty and satisfying dish.
