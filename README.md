# odin-recipes

This web page is for providing recipe about my favorite meals.

The current project is just in plain html language but I learned little bit on how to properly structure a page. 

I also realized that creating plain html is really boring. Finishing it is really a pain but it helps me push through in learning boring things. I say even if its boring I had fun doing it even if it is just a little bit.
